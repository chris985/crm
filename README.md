<!--I started building this application after disappointment with the apps currently on the market. The biggest apps out there are big, bloated, have a huge learning curve and downright disgusting interfaces that made me sick to my stomach. Some are web-based, but others require downloading companion apps and installing various companion programs to run. Other apps do one or two items related to a CRM but leave out the crucial pieces or hide them behind a paywall.

My idea with this app is to build a brand-new CRM that looks great and has all the functionality you would need to run a business, ideally for an IT business such as technical support or a project-based business such as web design or development. The goal is that it can eventually evolve into an app that suits many tastes but remains simple in nature.-->

** NOTE: THIS APP IS IN HEAVY DEVELOPMENT, THIS IS NOT A "PUBLIC" RELEASE BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION. **

## Features <a name="features"></a>
* Run your business with ease keeping track of contacts, projects, and finances, with an easy to use and appealing modern interface.
* Built to replace aging CRM-systems or limited and costly "free" software available online
* A full-fledged business CRM that you manage yourself from the web or a local server.
* Track contacts and all their related information including addresses contact numbers and emails.
* Track finances with invoicing, expense tracking, and quote-building functionality.
* Complete helpdesk tool tracks support tickets and projects.
* Staff management to keep track of employees, timesheets, time-off, bonuses, contracts, and paychecks.
* Calendar and time tracking features.

Note some of these features are not implemented in current build.

## What's New? <a name="new"></a>
Build: 0.0.0.11 Updated the documentation structure and layout to look less intimidating. Current Build is BROKEN. Began conversion to UiKit3 over Bootstrap for layout. People section started but not finished, likely broken.

** The LAST 'stable' build is 0.0.0.8. ** We are rapidly approaching 0.0.1.0 -a major alpha release candidate! The 'master' branch will work towards this new release candidate which includes a major code revamp as we migrate to a new UI.
